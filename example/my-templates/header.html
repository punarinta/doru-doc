<h3>General</h3>

<p>
    An API method is always called via an HTTP POST request to an entity-named endpoint. Exact method name and any
    possible parameters are placed into the request payload and encoded as a JSON string. RPC model has a routing
    advantage over REST in our quite complex case and allows us to use the same API calls internally if we need to
    prerender JSON data into the view before serving the page.
</p>
<p>
    API uses <em>camelCased</em> names rather than <em>under_scored</em>.

<h3>HTTP request structure</h3>
<p>All the fields except <strong>method</strong> are not obligatory.</p>
<pre>
{
    "method": "someMethod",   // method name
    "data":
    {
        ...                   // all the function arguments go here
    }
    "pageStart": 0,           // data output starting row
    "pageLength": 10          // data output row limit
}</pre>

<p>
    If no output page limit is specified, then no limitation is performed. Normally you will not need to use
    pagination as in many cases nice filtering is available within the methods themselves.
</p>

<h3>Responses structure</h3>
<pre>
{
    "isError": false,         // a boolean showing the overall operation result
    "errMsg": null,           // possible error message string
    "data":
    {
        ...                   // output from the called method
    }
}</pre>

<hr>
<h3>HTTP response codes</h3>

<table class="real-table">
    <thead>
    <tr><th>Code</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr><td>400</td><td>Invalid data was sent.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>401</td><td>Function requires proper authentication.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>403</td><td>Access for the current user is denied.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>404</td><td>Function doesn't exist.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>500</td><td>Internal error or an undefined situation.</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<hr>
<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p>
    If user login was successful the server sends back the session identifier (<strong>sessionId</strong>
    property in the response structure). This identifier may be later sent together with any API call to work
    within the same login session. Identifier is sent in an HTTP header <strong>Token</strong>.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>
    For testing purposes one may use a version of API connected to a test database
    (<a href="https://t-api.s.coursio.com/">https://t-api.s.coursio.com/</a>). All external services (e.g. payments
    providers) connected to this version are also in test mode. Test database is at regular intervals synchronized
    with a production one, so do not count on keeping your data there for a long period.
